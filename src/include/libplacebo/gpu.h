// since it tries targetting a very small common subset of features that is
// needed to implement libplacebo's rendering.

// NOTE: When speaking of "valid usage" or "must", invalid usage is assumed to
// result in undefined behavior. (Typically, an error message is printed to
// stderr and libplacebo aborts - but this is not guaranteed). So ensuring
// valid API usage by the API user is absolutely crucial. If you want to be
// freed from this reponsibility, use the higher level abstractions provided by

// completed before using it in libplacebo again.
//
// Please note that this function returning does not mean the memory is
// immediately available as such. In general, it will mark a buffer as "in use"
// in the same way a read or write would, and it is the user's responsibility
// to wait until `pl_buf_poll` returns false before accessing the memory from
// the external API.
//
// In terms of the access performed by this operation, it is not considered a
// "read" or "write" and therefore does not technically conflict with reads or
// writes to the buffer performed by the host (via mapped memory - any use of
// `pl_buf_read` or `pl_buf_write` would defeat the purpose of the export).
// However, restrictions made by the external API may apply that prevent this.
//
// The recommended use pattern is something like this:
//
// while (loop) {
//    const struct pl_buf *buf = get_free_buffer(); // or block on pl_buf_poll
//    // write to the buffer using the external API
//    pl_tex_upload(gpu, /* ... buf ... */); // implicitly imports
//    pl_buf_export(gpu, buf);
// }
//
// i.e. perform an external API operation, then use and immediately export the
// buffer in libplacebo, and finally wait until `pl_buf_poll` is false before
// re-using it. (Or get a new, fresh buffer in the meantime)

// forbidden while a buffer is "in use". This includes using `pl_buf_read` or
// `pl_buf_write` or accessing mapped memory directly. The only exception to
// this rule is multiple reads, for example reading from a buffer with
// `pl_tex_upload` while simultaneously reading from it using mapped memory.
//
// The `timeout`, specified in nanoseconds, indicates how long to block for

// bound. This function does not provide hard latency guarantees.
//
// Note: Performing multiple libplacebo operations at the same time is always
// valid, for example it's perfectly valid to submit a `pl_tex_upload`
// immediately followed by a `pl_tex_download` to the same buffer. However,
// when this is the case, it's undefined as to when exactly the upload is
// happening versus when exactly the download is happening. So in this example,
